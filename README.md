# Popped
Running popped on your computer with all the source files provided opens the game on your default browser. 
The game allows the user to burst virtual bubble wrap and reset it when finished. 

## MemeSound
To experiment, I have added an aletrnate sound which is a refernce to one of the many popular memes. 

## Slow mo
There is a slow motion visual fuctionality added to show the process of bursting a bubble. Does not affect the main game, simply an experiment.
